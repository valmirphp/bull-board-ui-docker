# BULL-BOARD

REF: [https://github.com/felixmosh/bull-board](https://github.com/felixmosh/bull-board)

## Local passport auth example

This example shows how to secure your bull-board using local passport strategy.

### Notes

1. It will work with any **cookie** based auth, since the browser will attach
   the `session` cookie automatically to **each** request.
